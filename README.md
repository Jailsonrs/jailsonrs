Hi, I'm Jailson!

I am a data scientist with over 5 years of experience in the field, specializing in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I completed my studies in statistics at the Federal University of Cear√° and have since worked on implementing recommendation systems, churn and score prediction models, and deep learning models using technologies such as R, Python, Scala, and Spark.

In my most recent role, I leveraged LSTM models in Tensorflow to predict the probability of clicks and estimate CTR for targeted marketing campaigns on Facebook. By doing so, I significantly improved the lead capture rate and helped drive better ROI for the campaigns.

I am experienced in the entire lifecycle of predictive model development, from data collection, analysis, hypothesis testing, model formulation, productization, to monitoring. To streamline my data workflows, I use Airflow for data orchestration and Jenkins for automating DataOps pipelines.

If you're looking for someone who can help you with your data analysis, machine learning, or data visualization needs, feel free to reach out to me.
